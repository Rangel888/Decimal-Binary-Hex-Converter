<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>This <b>Java</b> based GUI converter takes in a user inputted value and converts it to the other two equivalent values. I decided to do this
project to understand the logic behind the various converters I utilized in my undergraduate studies. During an error filled input, the screens will lock out and 
force the user to press the clear button to restart operations. Additionally, after a successful attempt the screen will also lock out to maintain the 
integrity of the values that need to be referenced. <b>HTML</b> was utilized for the formatting of the error messages. Below are the methods that were used to their descriptions</p>
